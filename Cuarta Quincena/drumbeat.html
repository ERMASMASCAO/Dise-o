    <h1>Program</h1>
    <img src="Imágenes/program.png">
        <p><strong> Imagine a folk festival with many different tents </strong> - tents for all different sorts of music, a tent where you learn how to fiddle, and maybe on where you make drums. Each has its focus.People move form tent to tent making up their own experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>The Dtumbeat Festival will work exactly like this.</strong>We'll have all kinds of spaces where you can teach and learn - studios,labs,playgrounds,classrooms and even a few tents in the public square. Eachspace will provide a place to dive deep and get your hands dirty with some of the most interesting ideas at the intersection of learning, freedom and the web.</p>
    <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>Want to know exactly what's going to happen? You can see the draft schedule here on the Festival wiki. We're still evolving the details - but the general themes and style of sessions will give you a feel for what's going to happen. You can also read the activities page on the wiki for more detailed information.</p>
